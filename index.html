    <h1 style="font-size:10vw;">GONOHE MUSIC FESTIVAL CANCELLED</h1>

    <p style="font-size:5vw;">After five years of making beautiful music together at Kowataritai Park, we regret to announce that there will be no Gonohe Music Festival this year.
        <br><br>Hopefully this doesn’t come as a surprise, as we’ve been quiet the last few months, but after working hard to find a way to make the festival happen, we ultimately decided that we were unable to deliver the kind of event you’ve come to expect from us.
        <br><br>For those who were looking forward to the festival this year, please know that we’re planning to come back bigger and better than ever and we look forward to dancing together in the park once again.
        <br><br>Dave Herlich & Michael Warren Gonohe Music Festival</p>
